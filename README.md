 The Bosch BME280 is a simple but high resolution pressure/humidity/temperature sensor, which can be used in its high resolution
 mode but with power consumption of 20 microAmp, or in a lower resolution mode with power consumption of
 only 1 microAmp. The choice will depend on the application.

 The AMS CCS811 is an air quality sensor that provides equivalent CO2 and volatile organic measurements from direct
 I2C register reads as well as current and voltage (effective resistance of the sensing element). Gas sensors, including 
 this MEMs gas sensor in the CCS811 measure resistance of a substrate that changes when exposed to inert gases and 
 volatile organic compounds. Changed in concentration vary exponentially with the changes in resistance. The CCS811
 has an embedded ASIC calibrated against most common indoor pollutants that returns a good estimate of
 equivalent CO2 concentration in parts per million (400 - 8192 range) and volatile organic componds in parts per billion (0 - 1187).
 The sensor is quite sensitive to breath and other human emissions.
 
 ## How to compile and run
 
The sketch isn't a proper library and you can't use the library
tool to install it. 
1. Unzip the file in the directory where you store your
Arduino sketches.
2. Open the main sketch in the Arduino IDE. 
3. Open BME280.h, BME280.cpp, CCS811.h and CCS811.cpp in the tabs. 
4. Compile
